<b><font size="6">English</font></b>

The six-year English Language (EL) curriculum aims to develop children to be confident and effective communicators of the English Language. It is aligned with the National Syllabus and STELLAR curriculum. Language is a means of communication, guided by purpose, audience, context and culture; hence language learning is a meaningful and an engaging experience for our children in CCPS.  
  
<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">The EL Programme aims to:</font></b>

 *   Instil a love for lifelong reading.
 *   Develop critical thinking through extensive reading and responding to texts.
 *   Develop in children a good level of language proficiency to enable effective speaking, reading and writing.
 *   Help children interact effectively by making the correct linguistic choices to suit purpose, audience, context and culture.
 *   Emphasise differentiation of instruction to meet the special needs, abilities and interests of our children.

<br>
<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">The foundation of EL learning will be strengthened through:</font></b>
<br><br>

*   A greater focus on oral communication – listening &amp; speaking
*   Enjoyment in the learning of English through fun-filled activities
*   The explicit teaching of grammar in context (focus on word, phrase &amp; sentence level grammar)
 *   Phonemic awareness, phonics &amp; early literacy skills – lay foundation for acquiring reading fluency, comprehension &amp; viewing skills and strategies progressively
 *   Word study skills and extensive reading &amp; viewing – building &amp; use of vocabulary progressively
 *   Development of writing skills &amp; learner strategies
 *   Extensive opportunities for engagement in sustained, authentic &amp; creative writing

<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">Reading Intervention:</font></b>
<br>
The Reading Intervention Programmes include the following:  

<b>Language Support Programme (LSP)</b>
<br>
This is an MOE’s early intervention programme for Primary 1 and Primary 2 children who have not attained developmentally appropriate language and literacy skills in English Language. Children who enter Primary 1 and struggle with oral and reading skills will be taught basic oral language, reading and spelling skills so that they can learn and follow in their regular classes. These children will continue with the programme in Primary 2 if they have not attained developmentally appropriate language and literacy skills in English.  
<br>
<b>Remedial Reading Programme (RRP)</b>
<br>
RRP is another of MOE’s additional literacy support programmes and is implemented at Primary 3 and Primary 4 for children who still have weak literacy skills despite having completed the Learning Support Programme in Primary 1 and Primary 2. The programme teaches children a range of strategies for reading and reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their learning in their regular classrooms.  
<br>
<b>School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR)</b>
<br>
SDR is a 2-year intervention programme to support identified children with dyslexia in Primary 3 and Primary 4. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists. In Primary 3, children are taught reading and spelling skills to help them learn better in their regular classes. In Primary 4, children are also taught comprehension skills, in addition to reading and spelling skills.  
<br>
<b>Structured Reading Programme</b>
<br>
This programme aims to provide targeted reading support for children in P1 and P2 who need help to decode independently through the acquisition of phonics &amp; phonological awareness (sound blending) and the reading high frequency words. 
<br><br>
<b>Extensive Reading Programme</b>
<br>
This programme aims to help children expand and extend children’s reading beyond the curriculum.  

<br>

<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">Effective Communication:</font></b>

<b>Show &amp; Tell</b>
<br>
Show &amp; Tell is part and parcel of the Primary 1 &amp; Primary 2 EL curriculum. It provides opportunities for children to build up their confidence level, self-esteem, social and listening skills. This helps them to become confident communicators.  
<br>
<b>Retelling</b>
<br>
Retelling activity has been rolled out for Primary 3 &amp; Primary 4 children as part of their EL learning in the classroom. Retelling promotes thinking and metacognition along with Think Aloud, KWL and generating questions. It also provides opportunities for children to improve their verbal and comprehension skills as children begin to understand sequence, plot, and characterization as they build vocabulary and comprehension skills.  
<br>
<b>1-Minute Talk:</b>
<br>
This activity is aimed at Primary 5 &amp; Primary 6 children to help children build up their oracy skills as well as to make them think on their feet. Children need to express their opinions and views on a given topic within a minute using appropriate vocabulary.     

<br>

<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">Writing</font></b>

<b>Canossian Writing Programme</b>
<br>
Our Canossian Writing Programme recognises our children as writers who seek to hone their craft. Carefully-crafted mini-lessons allow for the discussion and unpacking of authentic mentor texts for children to develop different writing techniques and styles. Teachers model the process by working on their own writing and conduct conferences with individual children. The children’s written work is then published for their peers to read so that children grow comfortable seeing themselves as part of a writing community, become more willing to take more risks and dive deeper into the process. In addition, they can get ideas from their peers’ writing.  
<br>
<b>Creative Writing</b>
<br>
Creative Writing has been introduced in Primary 1 &amp; Primary 2 to encourage children to exercise their creativity and use their imagination. At the same time, students are provided with opportunities to develop their ‘voice’ and communicate their thoughts and ideas freely. An annual Creative Writing Competition is also conducted for our children.  
<br>
<b>Journaling</b>
<br>
Children are encouraged to read widely and respond to what they read. Journaling aims to develop children’s personal response and critical thinking skills.  

<br>

<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">I Love Literature:</font></b>  

In line with the latest English Language Syllabus, "<em>I Love Literature</em>" gives every child a head-start in a literature-based approach to EL learning with an emphasis on critical thinking, life skills and vocabulary. Our children participate in lively discussions on these literary works to make meaningful connections. They are inspired by the writer’s craft, language and style and are given opportunities to respond in creative ways to what they have read.
