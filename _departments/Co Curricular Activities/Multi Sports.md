<b><font size="6">Multi-Sports</font></b>

Multi-Sports is a recreational sports club that offers a platform to expose children to a variety of sports and games such as creative skipping, mini tennis, netball and basketball etc. Through such exposure, children will have the opportunity to discover and develop their interest in sports and games, which is an important step for them towards leading a healthy lifestyle.

Besides coaching children in the fundamental skills and techniques of the games, some game rules are introduced progressively to enable children to appreciate the games and demonstrate their skills in the right settings.
