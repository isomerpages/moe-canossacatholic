<b><font size="6">Track and Field</font></b>

Track and field is a sport that comprises of running, jumping and throwing events. Our Track and Field team members train weekly on&nbsp;Mondays and Thursdays.  
  
During training, under the guidance of our dedicated teachers&nbsp;and coaches, our members strive for excellence and are motivated to achieve their personal best. Their training prepares them mentally and physically to take part in championships such as the National School Games.  
  
Apart from the strength and conditioning exercises that are carried out during each training session, our members are challenged to work on their cardiovascular fitness and maintain a healthy weight.  
  
Through Track and Field, our members develop a love for exercising and maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle for life.
