<b><font size="6">Guitar Ensemble</font></b>

CCPS Guitar Ensemble is comprised of a group of children who know how to play guitar, those who want to learn how to play guitar, and others who want to become better guitar players.  

Introduced in 2021, the children will be exposed to a variety of skills â€“ learning guitar chords, reading musical notes, honing the strumming technique and playing a myriad of songs. During CCA practices on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the children also learn the importance of playing together in harmony. Currently in its early stages, children are perfecting recognizing of chords and learning to play simple songs.
