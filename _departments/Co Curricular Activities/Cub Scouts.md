<b><font size="6">Cub Scouts</font></b>

The Canossa Catholic Cub Scout Group was inaugurated on 19 January 2021 with our first batch of 15 boys.&nbsp;  
  
The aim of the group is to provide the Cub Scouts with the opportunities to develop their physical, intellectual, emotional and social capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve the aim, the troop meetings are structured with varied activities where there are opportunities to explore, to learn, to serve and to lead.  
  
Some activities that the Cub Scouts will get to experience include map reading, knotting, hiking, art and craft, outdoor cooking, camping, values-in-action programmes and performing. Through these activities, the Cub Scouts will grow in self-leadership and peer leadership which will in turn give them the competency to make a contribution to the society in future.
