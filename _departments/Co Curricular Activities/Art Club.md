<b><font size="6">Art Club</font></b>

The Art Club provides opportunities for members to learn about art techniques beyond the school’s art curriculum. Members derive great enjoyment creating artwork with these techniques. They draw, paint, produce inspiring collages and make ceramics.   

Several art pieces have also been selected as gifts for Guests-of-Honour at prestigious events. Our members’ artwork also adorns the walls in our school compound. Outstanding masterpieces by our members have also been showcased at exhibitions by external organisations.
