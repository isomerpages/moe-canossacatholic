Brownies, originally called Rosebuds, was first founded by Lord Baden-Powell in the year 1914. The activities are tailored for young girls aged 7 to 12 and are guided by a comprehensive 5-point programme which encompasses;<br>

<b>(1)</b> Personal &amp; Social Development – Healthy Me, Courteous Me, Cultured Me <br>
<b>(2)</b> Home – Safety &amp; Duties<br>
<b>(3)</b> Outdoor – Discovering Nature, A Green World<br>
<b>(4)</b> Community – My Country, My Neighbourhood <br>
<b>(5)</b> International – My Brownie Friend, My World <br>

Brownies are given opportunities to develop lifeskills such as good grooming, sewing, gardening and the active conservation of the environment by reusing materials to create useful objects.&nbsp;

Living out the Brownies’ motto, Brownies ‘Lend a Hand’ to play their part in the community. They learn how to work both independently and as a team. They also acquire positive values such as compassion and loyalty. Through meaningful activities, they forge lasting friendships and emerge cheerful, compassionate, honest and responsible young ladies who have a heart to serve God, country and man.

In 2019 and 2020, the Brownies pack clinched the coveted ‘Silver’ Puan Noor Aishah Award.
