<b><font size="6">Handbell Ensemble</font></b>

Introduced only in 2023, our young Handbell Ensemble has proven to be a team full of potential and great talent. 

Despite being a young team of ringers, our Handbell Ensemble has already performed in various school events and participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2024. During their practices, the students learn about teamwork by ringing the handbells together. Each and every one of them is important and play a crucial role in producing the various sounds of the music pieces.
