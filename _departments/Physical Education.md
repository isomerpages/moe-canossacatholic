Physical Education (PE) in CCPS aims to develop physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly.

Five goals serve as a guide to provide an array of opportunities for the children.

* <b><font color="#eeac0d">Movement Competence</font></b><br>
Children are competent and confident to participate in a range of physical and outdoor activities.
<br>
* <b><font color="#eeac0d">Healthy Lifestyle Practices</font></b><br>
Children have a personal commitement to healthy lifestyle practices in physical activity, nutrition, sleep, outdoor time and hygiene.
<br>
* <b><font color="#eeac0d">Safety Mindset</font></b><br>
Children apply risk assessment to manage daily and physical activities with respect to self, others and the environment.
<br>
* <b><font color="#eeac0d">Core Values</font></b><br>
Children make informed and responsible decisions with regard to personal behaviour and social interactions based on sound values-based judgements.
<br>
* <b><font color="#eeac0d">Enjoyment</font></b><br>

<br>
Each goal lsited above interact with one another in a well-planned Physical Education curriculum that addresses the understanding, skills, practices and values desired for each child.

Though the PE curriculum focuses on a spiral progression on the children's development of different fundamental motor skills, and manipulative skills safely through a variety of physical settings and different mediums across the levels.

Leveraging on this sound and strong PE curriculum, P.A.C.E is designed to cultivate a deep love for sports and outdoors and promote a lifelong healthy living attitude and nurture character.
  
At CCPS, we envision our children to be:
 

*  Physically Fit,
*  Adventurous,
*  Courageous and
*  Empowered Leaders through Sports
  
Through PACE, all CCPS children would be nurtured into young people who are future-ready, fit, healthy and strong mentally and physically. They will  
  
*   Build their emotional resilience and mental and physical perseverance so that they will have the energy and spirit to keep trying no matter how hard the odds may be; and
*   Learn to make decisions and take responsible risks as part of character formation
