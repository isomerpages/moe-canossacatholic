Leveraging on this sound and strong PE curriculum, P.A.C.E is designed to cultivate a deep love for sports and outdoors and promote a lifelong healthy living attitude and nurture character.
  
At CCPS, we envision our students to be:
 

*  Physically Fit,
*  Adventurous,
*  Courageous and
*  Empowered Leaders through Sports
  
Through PACE, all CCPS students would be nurtured into young people who are future-ready, fit, healthy and strong mentally and physically. They will  
  
*   Build their emotional resilience and mental and physical perseverance so that they will have the energy and spirit to keep trying no matter how hard the odds may be; and
*   Learn to make decisions and take responsible risks as part of character formation
