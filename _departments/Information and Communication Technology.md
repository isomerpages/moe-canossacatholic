In CCPS, digital technologies are meaningfully and purposefully integrated in the total curriculum to design a range of learning experiences for children to develop the knowledge, skills and disposition of future-ready learners. Teachers leverage on technology to creates a more participatory, connected and reflective classroom that makes learning more engaging, active and personalised.  

Children are also exposed to different learning experiences with technology. The main learning platform is MOE Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), which provides a safe and secure space for children to access a wide repertoire of learning materials created by MOE teachers.  
  
Children are also exposed to different learning technologies such as G Suite (Google), Nearpod, Classkick, Padlet, Kahoot, and even Augmented Reality platforms. Our teachers select appropriate technological tools based on pedagogical affordance to enhance learning processes, allowing children to acquire knowledge, collaborate with each other, discuss and inquire ideas, practice learning, and even produce and create with technology.

Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. It is important for children to tap on the potential of the Internet as well as to be aware of the dangers involved in their interaction with the cyber world. When navigating cyberspace, children should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Children should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating the positive use of technology for the good of the community.  
  
In CCPS, our cyber wellness curriculum anchors strongly on developing the right values to navigate the cyber landscape.  
  
Based on MOE Cyber Wellness framework (Figure 1), the school has designed suitable cyber wellness lessons and programmes, anchoring on our school values of Charity, Humility, Forgiveness and Faith, as well as on the guiding pillars of Carlo Acutis, Patron Saint of the Internet (Figure 2).

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">E-Learning Exercise</font></b>
  
CCPS conducts e-learning days for children, usually concurrently with Parents-Child-Teachers Conference (PCTC) / Meet the Parents (MTP) days. Teachers will design e-learning lessons on Student Learning Space (SLS) for children to attempt independently, The objectives of the exercise are to encourage children to take ownership for their own learning and to familiarise them with learning environment that is necessary in the event of school closure due to a national emergency.  
  
For device or broadband support, parents can refer to&nbsp;[IMDA NEU PC Plus](https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/neu-pc-plus)&nbsp;programme, or contact the school for advice.

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">Code For Fun Programme</font></b>
  
The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme is a collaboration between MOE and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), targeted at upper primary students. The programme includes learning of computational thinking concepts using visual-based programming language, combining it with robotic kits and/or microcontrollers, to create an engaging coding experience for the children. This programme helps to expose children to the skills needed to embrace new opportunities in the digital economy.  
  
Children learnt about computational thinking concepts, how these concepts could be applied to aspects of daily life, and basic programming concepts such as debugging. They also developed logical thinking and problem-solving skills by breaking down problems into bite-sizes through mini-challenges.
