In CCPS, digital technologies are meaningfully and purposefully integrated in the total curriculum to design a range of learning experiences for students to develop the knowledge, skills and disposition of future-ready learners. Teachers leverage on technology to creates a more participatory, connected and reflective classroom that makes learning more engaging, active and personalised.  
  
Students are also exposed to different learning experiences with technology. The main learning platform is MOE Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), which provides a safe and secure space for students to access a wide repertoire of learning materials created by MOE teachers.  
  
Students are also exposed to different learning technologies such as G Suite (Google), Nearpod, Classkick, Padlet, Kahoot, and even Augmented Reality platforms. Our teachers select appropriate technological tools based on pedagogical affordance to enhance learning processes, allowing students to acquire knowledge, collaborate with each other, discuss and inquire ideas, practice learning, and even produce and create with technology.
