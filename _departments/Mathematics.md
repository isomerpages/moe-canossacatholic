<b>P1 and P2 Learning Support for Mathematics</b>
<br>
Our Learning Support Programme for Mathematics (LSM) provides early intervention for Primary 1 and 2 students who need additional support in Mathematics. The programme focuses on basic mathematical skills and concepts to consolidate a good foundation. It aims to support the learners and build students’ confidence and positive beliefs about their ability to do Mathematics.  

<b>P3 to P6 Math Olympiad Programme</b>
<br>
Olympiad Training aims to stretch our high progressive students and sharpen their logical and analytical skills in problem solving. This enables our students to hone their skills for competitions such as the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad for Primary School (SASMO).  

<b>P1 to P6 Parents’ Workshop</b>
<br>
This workshop focuses on helping parents guide their child in solving word problems. Teachers would share and explain to parents various strategies used in solving Math problems, including the model method and various heuristics. Parents will be engaged in solving these Mathematics problems with their child in the workshop.  

<b>P1 to P5 Mathematics Championship</b>
<br>
Mathematics Championship aims to improve the factual fluency skills of all students and foster the love for Math. Consisting of two rounds, it is conducted once a term in Term 1, 2 and 3. Three finalists are selected from each class in a preliminary round and all finalists take part in the final round. Attractive prizes are awarded to all finalists and winners.  

<b>P1 to P6 Mathematics Learning Package</b>
<br>
Our Mathematics package aims to explicitly teach various skills. To better meet the diverse learning needs of our students, our teachers will vary the degree of scaffolding through differentiated instructions, developing and stretching our students’ mathematical reasoning and thinking skills.  

<b>P1 to P6 ICT Mathematics</b>
<br>
 Integrated lessons with the use of virtual manipulatives or other related websites will be conducted at least once a term. ICT tools can help students to understand mathematical concepts through visualization, exploration and experimentation while developing the students’ 21st century competencies such as self-directed learning and collaboration.

<b>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) Approach</b>
<br>
Learning experiences in the classroom are designed based on the C-P-A approach. The C-P-A approach builds on children’s existing knowledge by introducing abstract concepts in a concrete and tangible way. It involves moving from concrete materials, to pictorial representations, to abstract symbols and problems.
