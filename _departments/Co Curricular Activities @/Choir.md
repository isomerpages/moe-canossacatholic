<b><font size="6">Choir</font></b>

The CCPS Choir was formed in September 1999. It comprises of passionate students who love singing and performing to spread the joy that music brings. The Choir performs a variety of music – from classical music to popular music.  
  
During CCA practices on Mondays and Thursdays, members read music, identify minor and major chords and acquire different choral singing techniques. Besides the honing of their singing technique, members learn the importance of singing together in harmony.  
  
The many performance platforms – from school performances to choral learning journeys, national competitions and external performances such as charity concerts and Christmas caroling, provide opportunities for members to bond and develop greater confidence as they aspire for high standards of musicality.
