<b><font size="6">Support for Hearing Loss Students</font></b>

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">Overview</font></b>

The Satellite Partnership between Canossa Catholic Primary School (CCPS) and&nbsp;[Canossian School](http://www.canossian.edu.sg/)&nbsp;(CS) provides students from both schools with meaningful opportunities to interact and integrate.&nbsp;

Canossa Catholic Primary School (CCPS) will be a mainstream primary school designated to support students diagnosed with hearing loss (HL) using the ORal Approach from 2 January 2025. The restructuring of CCPS and Canossian School (CS) under 1 school banner - CCPS is a natural next step for both schools. 

Since 1999, CS and CCPS have enjoyed a close school partnership, providing students from both schools meaningful opportunities to interact. CS students have been learning alongside CCPS students for most of the schools days across different subjects. They experience recess together, go on learning journeys and school camps and participate in various school events together. 

To provide a more inclusive educational experience for the students, Canossa Mission Singapore (CMS) decided to restructure CS and CCPS under a single school, CCPS. With 25 years of strong school partnership, this restructuring will deepen the existing inclusive culture and build a community where the students diagnosed with hearing loss will have more opportunities to learn and play alongside their hearing peers. 

Students from both schools will continue to study together in the same form and participate alongside one another in all school activities. Through interacting with differently-abled peers, the students will cherish each other's unique gifts and talents. In journeying together, they will learn that while they may be different from one another, they will always be equal in dignity.

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">Continuing CS' Support for students with HL</font></b> 

For students diagnosed with HL enrolled in CCPS through the designated programme, educational support will be provided to strnegthen their communication and language skills by teachers supporting hearing loss. They will also have access to onsite audiology, speech language and other relevant therapy support. 

The students will also receive social emotional support aimed at inclusion, learning and identity. This includes greater support from both CCPS teachers and teachers supporting HL in their learning and character development. 

The whole range of CCA offereings, school programmes and leadership opportunities for existing students of CCPS will be made available to all students, including the current students of CS. The provision of increased opportunities for students diagnosed with HL to interact with their peers will help to strengthen interpersonal skills and allow for emotional expression and growth.

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">Benefits of the Satellite Partnership</font></b> 

The Satellite Partnership helps CCPS students to develop empathy and perspective-taking as they learn to see and hear the world through the eyes and ears of their peers with hearing loss. It allows CS students to be immersed in a language-rich environment, thus enabling them to develop and hone their listening skills through the use of hearing devices.&nbsp;

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">Staff Development through the Satellite Partnership</font></b>

  
Staff at CCPS attend professional development workshops conducted by the CS audiology department to learn about hearing loss, the challenges that students with hearing loss face in the classroom, and strategies that would mitigate these challenges. Staff are also taught to use the Roger FM transmitter, a wireless transmitter that transmits the speaker’s voice directly into the students’ hearing devices.
