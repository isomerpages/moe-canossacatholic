<b><font size="6">Satellite Partnership</font></b>

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">Overview</font></b>

The Satellite Partnership between Canossa Catholic Primary School (CCPS) and&nbsp;[Canossian School](http://www.canossian.edu.sg/)&nbsp;(CS) provides students from both schools with meaningful opportunities to interact and integrate.&nbsp;

This special partnership gives students from both schools the opportunity to learn and participate in all activities, academic and non-academic, side by side. Through encountering peers who are different from themselves, the students learn to cherish each other’s unique gifts and talents. It is through journeying together that the students learn that while they may be different from each other in every way, they will always be equal in dignity.

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">History of the Satellite Partnership</font></b> 

The partnership between CCPS and CS started in 2000, with selected CS girls being integrated into Canossa Convent Primary School, then an all-girls primary school. Selected Upper Primary CS boys were integrated into MacPherson Primary School, a co-educational school. By 2010, all CS students were integrated into either Canossa Convent Primary School or MacPherson Primary School.&nbsp;

In 2019, Canossa Convent Primary School was renamed Canossa Catholic Primary School as it took in its first batch of Primary 1 boys as a co-educational school. That same year, MacPherson Primary School was merged with Cedar Primary. As such, 2019 marked the milestone in which all CS students, girls and boys alike, were integrated into CCPS.&nbsp;

<b><font size="5" color="#7daadf">How the Satellite Partnership looks like</font></b>

Students from both schools attend all non-academic lessons, such as P.E., Art, Music and Social Studies, together. As for academic lessons, students from CS will join their CCPS peers in English, Mathematics and Science according to each student’s readiness.&nbsp;  
  
Both CS and CCPS students take part in special programmes such as camps, overseas trips, enrichment lessons and life skills workshops. These programmes not only enhance their educational experience but give them further opportunities to interact and bond with one another.

The Satellite Partnership helps CCPS students to develop empathy and perspective-taking as they learn to see and hear the world through the eyes and ears of their peers with hearing loss. It allows CS students to be immersed in a language-rich environment, thus enabling them to develop and hone their listening skills through the use of hearing devices.&nbsp;

Staff at CCPS attend professional development workshops conducted by the CS audiology department to learn about hearing loss, the challenges that students with hearing loss face in the classroom, and strategies that would mitigate these challenges. Staff are also taught to use the Roger FM transmitter, a wireless transmitter that transmits the speaker’s voice directly into the students’ hearing devices.
