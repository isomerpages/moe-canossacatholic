**<font size=6>Humble Beginnings</font>** <br>
Starting small, <br>
Standing tall. <br>
Big dreams began -<br>
Fuelled by noble purpose.<br>
	
<br>
Title deed bestowed,<br>
For land at Sallim Road -<br>
God's bountiful supply -<br>
For His Work to be fulfilled.<br>
	
	<br>
How can one begin to describe the excitement felt -<br>
Of unspoken possibilities and opportunities?<br>
  
<br>
15 Aug 1941-<br>
Doors opened officially<br>
Potential brimming over -<br>
Sadly only to be stifled when war broke out -  
<br>
<br>
How can one begin to fathom -<br>
The horrors and challenges of war? <br>
<br>
	
What did the future hold?<br> 
 <br>

Would we overcome?<br>
<br>
	
Prayers like sweet music;<br>
Released from faith-filled hearts.<br>
Songs of salvation and restoration,<br>
Reviving tenacious hope.<br>
<br>	

How can one ever underestimate the power of prayer;<br>
The immeasurable potential in humble beginnings?<br>
<br>
	
Starting small, <br>
Standing tall. <br>
Big dreams resumed once the war blew over -<br>
Canossa Convent Primary School -<br>
Birthed from noble aspiration.

1938 - this was the rural scene of Sallim Road when the Sisters first acquired the 5.5 acres of land for $11,000 - swampy and surrounded mainly by vegetable farms.

It was a time of celebration when the Sisters received the title deed for the 5.5 acres of land issued by the Straits Settlements in 1941.

Love knows no bounds. Word about the good work of faith, hope and love by the Sisters in Canossa Convent Primary School spread throughout the community.

Canossa Convent Primary School was closed from 4 October 1944 to 8 September 1945 when the Japanese took it over as a military headquarters  
for Geylang District.

We were blessed by this wooden longhouse as the first Home for boys. They were cared for by the Sisters. On Sundays, it was used as a church.
