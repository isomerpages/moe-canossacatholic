<em>
<br>
Rev. Mother Farina<br>
Canossa Convent School<br>
From Mr Wong Kah Loong<br>
18 August 1958
</em>


In 1958, Mr Wong Kah Loong presented the bell to Rev. Mother Maria Farina, Principal of Canossa Convent School from 1954 – 1960.

Sister Theresa recalled the significance of the ringing of the bell: it was rung 15 times to signal that it was time to rise in the morning as only a few Sisters owned an alarm clock. It was rung 7 times to indicate that prayer was about to begin. 

The bell was also rung in different combinations of rhythm to look for specific Sisters to inform them they had a visitor. 

Today, the bell system still exists in some houses  in the form of an electrical buzzer to inform sisters when they have visitors. 

Having restored our 63-year-old bell in 2021, the tradition of ringing the bell lives on in our school. Every morning, the bell is rung 7 times to quiet our students for the first prayer of the day.
