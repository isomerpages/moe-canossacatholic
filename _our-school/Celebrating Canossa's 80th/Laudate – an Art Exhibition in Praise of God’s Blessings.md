_Laudate_, our Art Exhibition in Praise of God’s Blessings, is starting this weekend. You and your family are warmly invited to join us.

The art exhibition will be open for public viewing from Saturday, 30 July 2022, through to Tuesday, 2 August 2022, at Visual Art Center, Dhoby Ghaut Green.

Come join us to celebrate our amazing children and their art works! There will also be art pieces from various inter-religious communities, CCPS alumnae and our sister schools – the St Anthony’s Canossian Primary and Secondary Schools – at the exhibition as well.
