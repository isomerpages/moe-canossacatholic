<b><font size=4 color="#eeac0d">Bread Door</font></b>

Mother Foundress, St Magdalene of Canossa, spread her love of Jesus through works of great service to the poor and the sick. The needy would sit at benches situated at her palace gate which was fondly known as The Bread Door. This was where they received abundant bread and provisions from Mother Foundress.

  

In the spirit of the generous giving that took place at The Bread Door, our Canossian Sisters continue to distribute bread and provisions to the needy. The Primary 6 students of Canossa Catholic Primary School emulate Mother Foundress' act of love with the school's Bread Door project, baking bread to bless others like the elderly.

<br>
<br>
Every year, students of Canossa Catholic Primary School live out the school’s core value of Charity by making personal sacrifices as a Gift of Love for the less fortunate. Putting aside part of their daily allowance over a period of 40 days during Lent, our students present these love offerings in beautiful money boxes which they create using recyclables. The amount collected is presented to Canossa Mission Singapore, the charity arm of our Canossian Sisters.

As part of Canossa Catholic Primary School’s Lenten project, students are encouraged to spread the magic of kindness through little acts of mercy so that those around them will experience 40 days of love, grace and kindness.
