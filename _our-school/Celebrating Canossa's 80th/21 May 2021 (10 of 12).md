When Canossa Convent Primary School first opened, there were boys in the boarding house looked after by the Sisters. They attended school with the girls. As the emphasis was to cater to girls who then had limited opportunities to receive an education, Canossa Convent Primary School became a school for only girls. In moving with the times and responding to the needs of the community, the decision in 2019 was to go back to being a co-ed school.

In 2019, Canossa Convent Primary School went officially co-ed to raise daughters and sons of Canossa with a Canossian education that is focused on character and formation of the heart.

To mark this historic milestone, the school flag was changed to bear the school’s new name, Canossa Catholic Primary School. A flag ceremony was conducted to raise the new school flag.

“We are very happy to welcome boys into our school. The boys will now have the privilege of a Canossian education where we focus on the formation of the heart … which means we will raise good sons for families and society,” said the Principal of Canossa Catholic Primary School, Mrs Eugenie Tan (_Source: Catholic News Singapore_)
