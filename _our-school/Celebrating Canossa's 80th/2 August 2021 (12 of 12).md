**<font size=5 color="#7daadf">A New Vision for a New Season</font>**

Write down the vision and inscribe it clearly on tablets, so that one who reads it may run. For the vision is yet for the appointed time; it hurries toward the goal and it will not fail. Though it delays, wait for it; for it will certainly come, it will not delay long. – Habakkuk 2:2-3  

  

As the school continues to answer God’s sacred call to form the hearts of our little ones, she humbly receives God’s vision to boldly enter a new season of raising not just girls, but also boys.

<b><font size=5 color="#7daadf">Every Canossian Girl and Boy</font></b><br>
**<font size=4 color="#eeac0d">A Leader of Hope, a Sower of Change**</font>

**Believing** that our children are a gift from God. Under His loving workmanship, they are moulded to be a blessing to one and all as they grow from glory to glory.


**Belonging** to this loving Canossian family, our children live a life of love, embracing others and promoting inclusivity.


**Becoming** what God has created our children to be — champions of life who believe right, live right, and reach out into the world to spread love, joy, hope and peace.


**Inspiring hope**<br>

**Leading change**
