<b><font size=5 color="#7daadf">Expansion in God's Grace</font></b>
	
God has been so good to us.<br>
He has expanded our territories.<br>
We have grown as a school -<br>
Rebuilt the school to cater to our needs<br>
Moved with the times to<br>
Embrace girls and boys in a co-ed setting.<br>
<br>
Inspired by Mother Foundress,<br>
Our Canossian Sisters' and educators' hearts have remained large and passionate -<br>
Dreaming big dreams for our little ones,<br>
Developing our students to attain their potential and<br>
Building them up to be leaders of hope<br>
And sowers of change<br>
So they can inspire others and<br>
influence improvement for the<br>
betterment of society and the world. <br>
<br>
Canossa Catholic Primary School -Â <br>
A dynamic, vibrant school - growing and blossoming in God's amazing grace.
