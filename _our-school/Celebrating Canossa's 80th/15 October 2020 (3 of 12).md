Laying the foundation for the promising future of each Canossian daughter and son are our Canossian Sisters. Their focus on values helped in the formation of the children's hearts. They worked tirelessly round the clock to plan numerous enriching activities for the children. Ahead of their time, the curriculum crafted by the Sisters developed our children holistically. They also equipped the children with life-skills to take care of themselves independently.
