**<font size=5 color="#7daadf">The Neverending Gift</font>**

Canossa Catholic Primary School has been a precious gift to generations of girls and boys since we officially began as a school on 15 August 1941. To honour the mission and vision of Mother Foundress, a special book entitled, ‘The Neverending Gift’ has been written. 

This book features the significant historical events experienced in the history of Canossa told from the voice of the school. Three amazing Canossians have also been featured in the book – Sister Enrica, beloved and faithful Canossian Sister, Uncle Tony, our old boy and founder of Willing Hearts, and Mrs Priscilla Ho, our old girl, and now teacher of the school.

This book was lovingly written by Mrs Michele Ho and illustrated by Mrs Claire Ng, and student Chan Kai Yin of 6 Hope (2021).

As we celebrate a life built on love which began with Mother Foundress, St Magdalene of Canossa, and is continued in the love and dedication of the Canossian Sisters, Canossian educators and our daughters and sons of Canossa, let us continue to journey together and share our personal stories on how we live out the Canossian values of Charity, Humility, Forgiveness and Faith, living in The Way, The Truth and The Life.
