Our school badge is meant for all Canossian Schools.<br>
On a dark-blue background there shines a four-pointed star with rays cast<br>
on to a book symbolizing the Star of wisdom radiating on Knowledge.

The star is a symbol of lofty ideas stirring a person to great and noble deeds.<br>
The star represents four basic social virtues –<b>Truth, Justice, Love and Freedom</b>

United in common endeavour  
At work, at play, life's lessons we learn  
Our youthful hearts are filled with ardour  
For truth and wisdom we yearn

<b>Chorus:</b>
<br>
Courageously with heads held high  
We march ever on through life  
Schooled in your spirit, Canossa  
For virtue, true nobility, we strive  
Schooled in your spirit, Canossa  
For true virtue we strive  
  
Our alma mater, our guardian, our guide  
Prepare our spirits for duty's call  
Our country to serve with virtuous might  
We stand for truth and for right

For true virtue we strive
