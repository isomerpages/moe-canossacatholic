Canossa Catholic Primary School (CCPS) is a co-educational Catholic school that centres its entire curriculum on the Canossian Education, which emphasizes on the Formation of the Heart. Previously known as Canossa Convent Primary School, it was established in 1941 by the Canossian Daughters of Charity in Singapore.  
  
The Canossian Education emulates the work and spirit of our foundress, St Magdalene of Canossa, to serve the poor in spirit and needs. It is inclusive and embraces children of all faiths and races.
