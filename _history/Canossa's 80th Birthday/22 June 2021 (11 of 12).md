**<font size=5>Our Strong And Growing Faith</font>**

For we walk by faith and not by sight. 2 Corinthians 5:7  
  
From the day our Canossian Sisters set foot in Singapore, they worked tirelessly to love, care and provide education for our children.  
  
Emulating the spirit and work of our Foundress, St Magdalene of Canossa, a large part of their work focused on the formation of the heart for both our staff and children, to instill in them the spirit of serving the poor.  
  
The Sisters’ unwavering faith in God saw them overcoming the challenges faced particularly during our early years as a school during the war.  
  
Today, our Canossian Sisters continue to be our source of inspiration. Guided by their strong and unwavering faith in God, they keep abreast of the changes in today’s ever-changing world and move with the times.  
  
Our Canossian Sisters’ presence and active involvement in school is pivotal to the faith formation of both our staff and children.
