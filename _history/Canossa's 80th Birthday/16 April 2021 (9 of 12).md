**Bread Door**
  

Mother Foundress, St Magdalene of Canossa, spread her love of Jesus through works of great service to the poor and the sick. The needy would sit at benches situated at her palace gate which was fondly known as The Bread Door. This was where they received abundant bread and provisions from Mother Foundress.

  

In the spirit of the generous giving that took place at The Bread Door, our Canossian Sisters continue to distribute bread and provisions to the needy. The Primary 6 students of Canossa Catholic Primary School emulate Mother Foundress' act of love with the school's Bread Door project, baking bread to bless others like the elderly.
