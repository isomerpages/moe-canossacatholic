 **<font size=5>Humble Beginnings</font>**
	
Starting small, <br>
Standing tall. <br>
Big dreams began -<br>
Fuelled by noble purpose.

  

Title deed bestowed,<br>
For land at Sallim Road -<br>
God's bountiful supply -<br>
For His Work to be fulfilled.

  

How can one begin to describe the excitement felt -<br>
Of unspoken possibilities and opportunities?<br>
  

15 Aug 1941-<br>
Doors opened officially<br>
Potential brimming over -<br>
Sadly only to be stifled when war broke out -

  

How can one begin to fathom -<br>
The horrors and challenges of war?

  

What did the future hold?

  

Would we overcome?

  

Prayers like sweet music;<br>
Released from faith-filled hearts.<br>
Songs of salvation and restoration,<br>
Reviving tenacious hope.

  

How can one ever underestimate the power of prayer;<br>
The immeasurable potential in humble beginnings?

  

Starting small, <br>
Standing tall. <br>
Big dreams resumed once the war blew over -<br>
Canossa Convent Primary School -<br>
Birthed from noble aspiration.
