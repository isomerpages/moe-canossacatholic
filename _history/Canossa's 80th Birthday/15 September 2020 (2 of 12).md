<font size=5>Devotion</font><br>
Rosary in hand,<br>
Bible verses recited and lived out daily;<br>
their willing hearts for God open<br>
to God's plan.<br>
Embracing the religious life,<br>
the love of God radiates - <br>
from their thought, word and deed.
<br><br>
  

Bible opened,<br>
they meditate on God's spiritual food.<br>
It ignites their missionary zeal<br>
and strengthens their resolve,<br>
empowering them to serve God and do His Work.<br>
They reach out willingly,<br>
loving and caring the poor.
<br><br>
  

God's voice speaks and they listen,<br>
poised obediently to be part of a movement.<br>
part of God's mission - <br>
to pioneer Canossian education in Singapore.<br>
They love the prospect and opportunity<br>
to be a blessing to the children there.
<br><br>
  

Every step of the way, God is with them - <br>
He leads, guides, protects them - <br>
valued members of the community of Canossian Sisters.<br>
Chosen by God to raise Canossian daughters and sons in Singapore. 
<br><br>
  

They welcome all children who enter the Convent - <br>
the abandoned child left at the door,<br>
the orphaned child crying on the streets.<br>
The Sisters love them all; they believe in them all.<br>
And their love - God's love in them - <br>
opens the children's doors to a better, brighter future.
<br><br>
  

Canossa Convent Primary School - <br>
born 15 August 1941 - <br>
God's vision conceptualised  and shaped - <br>
by the loving work<br>
of our Canossian Sisters' hands and hearts.
