**<font size=6>A Light in The Darkness</font>** 

On 7 December 1941, the Canossian Sisters rejoiced over the beatification of Mother Foundress at Saint Joseph's Church at Victoria Street. It was a joyous occasion. 

  

Unfortunately, the next day, during the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 1941, the first bombs fell on Singapore, signalling the start of a period of gloom for Singapore under the Japanese Occupation.

  

The beatification of Mother Foundress reminded the Sisters of the love, goodness and faithfulness of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving them the strength to continue their work to serve God and humanity with faith, hope and love even in this time of darkness.

**Our Hearts Sing Praise**

  

Praise be to God for the gift of <br>
Saint Magdalene of Canossa!<br>
Beacon of faith, hope and love to all humanity. 

  

Her personal struggles in life,<br>
Her deep devotion to God and Mother Mary,<br>
Eventually set her heart on fire <br>
to serve God and Man.<br>
In detaching herself from a life of earthly riches,<br>
She committed herself to serving the poor with purity of heart.

  

Foundress of the Canossian Sisters of Charity,<br>
Mother of Daughters and Sons of Charity<br>
She inspired others with the same <br>
unconditional love for the poor,<br>
And the same hunger to live a life of <br>
poverty and humble servitude.

  

A visionary, she recognised the sign of the times and courageously responded to them.<br>
With the conviction that even one person can make a difference in society,<br>
She initiated an evergreen mission to <br>
reach out to the poor.<br>
The hungry, she blessed with bread;<br>
The suffering sick, she cared and supported;<br>
For abandoned children, she sought to<br>
provide education.

  

Like a Mother, she generously showered her love on one and all - <br>
In her mission to educate, evangelise and <br>
provide pastoral care for the sick,<br>
making Jesus known and loved.

  

Her love, she wore on her sleeve - <br>
A badge of love, care and commitment to all.<br>
When darkness covered the world,<br>
Canossa's faithful light continued to shine!

  

Praise be to God for the gift of <br>
Saint Magdalene of Canossa!<br>
Beacon of faith, hope and love to all humanity.
