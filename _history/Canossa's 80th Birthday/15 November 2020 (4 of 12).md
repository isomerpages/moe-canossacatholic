**<font size=6>Expansion in God's Grace</font>**
<br>
God has been so good to us.  <br>
He has expanded our territories.  <br>
We have grown as a school -   <br>
Rebuilt the school to cater to our needs  <br>
Moved with the times to  <br>
Embrace girls and boys in a co-ed setting.  <br>
  <br><br>
Inspired by Mother Foundress,  <br>
Our Canossian Sisters' and educators' hearts have remained large and passionate -   <br>
Dreaming big dreams for our little ones,  <br>
Developing our students to attain their potential and   <br>
Building them up to be leaders of hope  <br>
And sowers of change  <br>
So they can inspire others and   <br>
influence improvement for the   <br>
betterment of society and the world.  <br>
  <br><br>
Canossa Catholic Primary School -   <br>
A dynamic, vibrant school - growing and blossoming in God's amazing grace.
