<font size=5>Expansion in God's Grace</font>

God has been so good to us.  
He has expanded our territories.  
We have grown as a school -   
Rebuilt the school to cater to our needs  
Moved with the times to  
Embrace girls and boys in a co-ed setting.  
  
Inspired by Mother Foundress,  
Our Canossian Sisters' and educators' hearts have remained large and passionate -   
Dreaming big dreams for our little ones,  
Developing our students to attain their potential and   
Building them up to be leaders of hope  
And sowers of change  
So they can inspire others and   
influence improvement for the   
betterment of society and the world.  
  
Canossa Catholic Primary School -   
A dynamic, vibrant school - growing and blossoming in God's amazing grace.
