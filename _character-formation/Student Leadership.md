<b><font size="3" color="#eeac0d"><em>"Those who love are never tired, since love knows no burden." - St Magdalene of Canossa</em></font></b>
</center>

<br>
Our school’s Student Leadership programme is anchored on the beliefs of our foundress and inspired by the life that she led. She led by caring and she cared by leading and inspiring others to serve with humility and love.

<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">Every Canossian a Leader of Hope</font></b>
<br><br>
Despite trying circumstances such as her father's death, her mother's departure and her poor health, St Magdalene continued to hope in the Lord and prayed fervently. At the age of 17, she believed that her calling was to the life of the cloister and decided to spend time in the Carmelite monastery in Verona. However, in the midst of doing so, she felt prompted to a more active service among the people.  
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">Every Canossian a Sower of Change</font></b>
<br><br>
Hankered to make a change, St Magdalene left the Canossa palace for good and started her first convent at the age of 34. Rather than just relying on genuine sources of prayer, medication, sacramental life, as well as the union with God, she saw a greater need for the convent to work for the good of others - particularly to improve the morality of the growing generation and to help the orphans, the fallen and the unfortunate.  
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="5" color="#eeac0d">No Canossian Left Behind</font></b>
<br><br>
St Magdalene's life works were largely influenced by her faith perspective that God makes every person equal in dignity. This means that everyone deserves respect and an equal opportunity to lead a meaningful and purposeful human life. She yearned to promote the growth of the person, especially that of the poorest: to educate, to evangelize and to assist the sick. But, her dream was not to be realised in her lifetime.
<br><br>
Today, Canossians continue to be inspired by St Magdalene's life, where  
Every Canossian is a Leader of Hope,  
Every Canossian is a Sower of Change and  
No Canossian is Left Behind.

Every child is called to be a Canossian Leader of Life who strives towards developing effective self-leadership skills i.e. 21st competencies taught in CCE and FTGP.

The Prefectorial Board is the pinnacle of our Student Leadership system.

<b>Day-to-Day Duties</b>
<br>
Being a prefect requires responsibility, dedication and above all, a heart to serve the school. Prefects are assigned daily duties to serve their teachers and peers and lead the student population through their role-modelling. Daily duties include serving at the St Magdalene’s Kitchen for breakfast, flag raising and recess duties.

<b>Prefect Meetings</b>
<br>
Prefect meetings are held monthly. The meetings serve as a platform for our prefects to work collaboratively to initiate, plan and execute events and projects. The projects undertaken by our prefects aim to serve their fellow schoolmates and meet specific areas of need in the school.

<b>Canossian Saints Week</b>
<br>
Canossian Saints Week is a week-long celebration of the lives led by our school’s foundress, St Magdalene, as well as St Bakhita. The prefects hold recess activities to educate the student population on the lives and legacy of our Saints. In the process, the prefects deepen their knowledge and love for the Canossian Saints.

<b>Prefects’ Investiture</b>
<br>
The Prefects’ Investiture is a milestone event for our prefects. It is a prestigious ceremony that formally introduces the prefects, who are appointed on a yearly basis, to the student population. During the ceremony, the executive committee is also installed and the prefects’ pledge is taken as a renewal of the prefects’ commitment and the call to serve.

<b>Student Leadership Training</b>
<br>
A student leadership training is held during the March holidays to equip our student leaders with the necessary skills to lead. During this training, both CCA leaders and prefects come together to learn skills like effective communication, proactivity and peer support through seminars and group activities led by the teachers.    

<b>Design Thinking Project</b>
<br>
Our prefects go through the design thinking process to kickstart projects that will meet the needs of the student population. During prefect meetings, our prefects are guided to find solutions to their selected problems.  

<b>Teachers’ Day Celebration</b>
<br>
Every year, our prefects take charge of the Teachers’ Day celebration. Over the course of Term 3, our prefects spend time preparing gifts for the teachers and working together to plan the celebration that is held at the end of the term.
