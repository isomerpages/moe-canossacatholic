**<font size=6>Student Leadership</font>**

**“_Those who love are never tired, since love knows no burden_." ~ St Magdalene of Canossa**

  
Our school’s Student Leadership programme is anchored on the beliefs of our foundress and inspired by the life that she led. She led by caring and she cared by leading and inspiring others to serve with humility and love.  
  
**<font size=5>Every Canossian a Leader of Hope</font>**

  
Despite trying circumstances such as her father's death, her mother's departure and her poor health, St Magdalene continued to hope in the Lord and prayed fervently. At the age of 17, she believed that her calling was to the life of the cloister and decided to spend time in the Carmelite monastery in Verona. However, in the midst of doing so, she felt prompted to a more active service among the people.  
  


**<font size=5>Every Canossian a Sower of Change</font>**

Hankered to make a change, St Magdalene left the Canossa palace for good and started her first convent at the age of 34. Rather than just relying on genuine sources of prayer, medication, sacramental life, as well as the union with God, she saw a greater need for the convent to work for the good of others - particularly to improve the morality of the growing generation and to help the orphans, the fallen and the unfortunate.  
  


**<font size=5>No Canossian Left Behind</font>**

  
St Magdalene's life works were largely influenced by her faith perspective that God makes every person equal in dignity. This means that everyone deserves respect and an equal opportunity to lead a meaningful and purposeful human life. She yearned to promote the growth of the person, especially that of the poorest: to educate, to evangelize and to assist the sick.  
  
But, her dream was not to be realised in her lifetime.  
  
Today, Canossians continue to be inspired by St Magdalene's life, where  
Every Canossian is a Leader of Hope,  
Every Canossian is a Sower of Change and  
No Canossian is Left Behind.  
  



**<font size=5>Class Service Roles and Student Leader Roles</font>**

Every student is called to be a Canossian Leader of Life who strives towards developing effective self-leadership skills i.e. 21st competencies taught in CCE and FTGP. Each student is given an opportunity to exercise their self-leadership skills and our school’s core values in the various class service roles like an ICT Representative and student leader roles such as Class Leader, CCA Leader.  
  


**<font size=5>Prefectorial Board</font>**

  
The Prefectorial Board is the pinnacle of our Student Leadership system. Students who personify our school’s core values of Charity, Humility, Forgiveness and Faith and show strong self-leadership qualities are nominated and interviewed for selection. Those who are selected to be prefects get to hone their leadership skills through various opportunities and programmes detailed below.
