Taking reference from Kouzes’ and Posner’s Student Leadership Challenge, Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others of Act, Encourage the Heart, aligning to our principles of a Canossian Leader and building on our school’s current tiered leadership, our children will be strengthened in the following aspects of leadership progressively through our 3-prong approach <b>Equipping - Empowering - Enriching</b> that frames the children’s learning and mastery, showcase and outreach platforms:
<br>
<br>

<b><font size="4" color="#eeac0d">Model the Way</font></b><br>
* Being the best version of themselves in everything they say and do <br>
* Knowing and doing what is good and just even when no one is watching<br>

<b><font size="4" color="#eeac0d">Inspire a Shared Vision</font></b><br>
* Knowing that they are created in God’s image and so is everyone else<br>
* Knowing their purpose in life<br>

<b><font size="4" color="#eeac0d">Challenge the Process</font></b><br>
* Being keenly aware that they can make things better <br>
* Making wherever they are a loving place <br>

<b><font size="4" color="#eeac0d">Enable Others to Act</font></b><br>
* Knowing that they still must grow <br>
* Making others feel belonged<br>

<b><font size="4" color="#eeac0d">Encourage the Heart</font></b><br>
