<b><font size=6>English Language</font></b>

The CCPS English Language Stretch Programme aims to develop students into creative and critical thinkers who develop a deep appreciation of the arts.

  
<b><font size=5 color="#7daadf">Exploring Genres</font></b>

Students are exposed to different genres where they learn about the form and function of different types of poetry or styles of creative writing. From there, students engage in in-depth discussions of how form expresses and enhances the meaning of the message communicated, thus developing their critical thinking and opening their eyes to a wide range of creative expression.   

  
<b><font size=5 color="#7daadf">Reading Circles</font></b>

Reading Circles comprises a community of readers whose discussions centre on a particular novel. Through the reader response approach, 
students bring their own background knowledge and understanding to bear as they interact with the content of the text to construct meaning.  

Students explore various aspects of the text, including its characters, relationships, themes and setting. For example, they may explore how individual characters transform over the course of the novel in response to the events that occur, or analyse the relationship between two character over the course of a single exchange.   

From there, students then step beyond the world of the novel to make connections with what is going on in their own world and context. For example, following a discussion about the values and beliefs of a character in the novel, students then reflect on the values and beliefs of their own school community and society, and identify how these guide their actions and decisions.
