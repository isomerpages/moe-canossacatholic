As part of the schoolâ€™s mission to nurture each child in his or her own way, the Stretch Programmes in CCPS aim to further develop the potential of students who display an aptitude for the academic subjects. They provide an enriched learning experience that develop intellectual curiosity and creative thinking in our students.  
  
The programmes offer students exposure to a broad range of topics and genres, offered to help them explore and discover their interests. These include creative writing, reading circles and poetry in English, puzzles and games in Mathematics, inquiry-based learning in Science, and poetry, idioms and ethnic literature in Mother Tongue.  
  
Recognising that growth does not occur in a linear fashion, with some students showing talent for specific subjects and at different timepoints as they mature, selection for our stretch programmes takes place on a yearly or semestral basis.
