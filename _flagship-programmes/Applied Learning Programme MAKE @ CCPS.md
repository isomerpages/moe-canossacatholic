<b><font size="6">Applied Learning Programme - M.A.K.E@CCPS</font></b>

  
  
We believe that every child in CCPS will

* Make a difference especially in sustaining the environment,<br>
* Apply Technology, Knowledge of Science &amp; Environment, and Mathematics,<br>
* Kindle their spirit of innovation through experimentation / prototyping, having the courage to try and not afraid of failing,<br>
* Exercise initiative in learning, making improvement and collaborating with others.<br>


Our children participate in various collaborative team-based project work. They learn to use technology to prototype and create solutions to help solve real-world environmental problems.  In order to enact childrens’ solutions in some way, block-based programming is introduced progressively across all levels through various coding modules and our students get to apply their Mathematics and Science concepts, reasoning and logical thinking in their projects which are anchored on the theme of sustainability. Having a focus on sustainability is part of the school’s response to Laudato Si, the Pope’s encyclical letter, which urges the Catholics to take action against the injustice of climate change and calls for care of our common home, Earth, and to protect the poor and future generations.

<br>
For our Tier 1 cohort-based programmes, we have:
* The Environment and Me (KUBO robotics)
* Saving the Environment (SCRATCHJr)
* Conservation of Environment I (SCRATCH)
* Conservation of Environment II (Microsoft MakeCode Arcade)


<br>

<br><br>
Our Primary 1 students are introduced to coding through KUBO Robotics, which provides a screen-free concrete experience in coding. Using tagtiles, they learn to programme the movements for KUBO, a little robot, and are introduced to the concept of direction and programme it to solve a real-world sustainability problem identified.

<br><br>
At Primary 2, our students learn how to programme an avatar using SCRATCH Jr (an introductory block-based coding programme), creating characters to move, swirl, follow lines and speak through dialogue texts. They explore environmental issues such as air pollution and their impact on the environment. Through storyboarding, they communicate to their audience how they can play their part in saving Mother Earth e.g. changing lifestyles which are sustainable.

<br><br>
Our Primary 3 students learn how to use Scratch (a block-based coding programme), and work together to create a game related to the conservation of environment (e.g energy conservation). They also learn to break down problems, recognise patterns by looking for similarities in problems faced and working out the steps to solve their problems.

<br><br>
At Primary 4, our students apply their knowledge in Science, Mathematics and technology as they use the programme, Microsoft MakeCode Arcade for creating a retro-style game so as to educate others on the environmental problem in a fun and easy to remember manner.  Through the collaborative project, our students learn to manage differences and problem solve as a team. They also learn the importance of resilience as they innovate and seek continuous improvement.

For students who are passionate in deepening their learning, we have the Tier 2 programmes:

* InfoComm Club members learn advanced programming tools (e.g. Micro:bit, Python)
* Interest Week students learn how to programme drones and game creation using AR (Augmented Reality)

In line with our school’s vision of Leaders of Hope, Sowers of Change, our school has been proactively impressing upon our students to respond to the call to fight climate change which is a global problem and to care for this earth, our home, God’s beautiful creation and preparing them to be responsible citizens to meet the complex environmental challenges we are currently facing.
