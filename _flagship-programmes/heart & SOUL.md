<b>heART &amp; Soul,</b>&nbsp;which is part of our&nbsp;[**HeARTs programme**](https://staging.d2nutevx25vdua.amplifyapp.com/departments/aesthetics), is our school’s distinctive art programme, designed to have a transformative impact on the students.  
  
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<em>Your soul is the part of you that consists of your mind, character, thoughts, and feelings. You can refer to someone's heart when you are talking about their deep feelings and beliefs.</em>
<br>
<font size="2"><em>- Definition heart and soul (taken from Collins Dictionary)</em></font>
</p>
<br>
Besides imparting the knowledge, skills and attitude in Art-making and Art-discussion, heART &amp; Soul shapes and engages the students’ heart and soul in what they do through their Art experience in the curriculum and environment. These art experiences allow the students to think out of the box and use uncommon materials to create Art. Students learn to see possibilities in everyday materials and creatively combine ideas to form new ideas.  
  
Even if they are not involved in art-related, creative fields in future, the capability to generate new ideas and draw insights will give the students a good stead to handle the challenges in the 21st century. And through their personal art expressions, the students are able to find their individual voice and inspire many hearts and souls.

<br>
<br>
Our Tier 1 6-years art curriculum is offered to all students as a foundation in art-making and art discussion. It promotes an inclusive culture and the holistic development of every student. Through art, students will learn about themselves and the world around them. The art modules are planned based on the “<em>Seeing, Expressing, Appreciating (SEA)</em>” approach.

<br>
<br>
The walls in our common spaces are transformed into a living art gallery, donned with murals and artworks. They generate artistic dialogues and serve to provoke and inspire students to take risks, share their experiences, and unlock their creative capacities. The artworks, which centre on God, play an integral part in nurturing and growing the faith of the students. Many of these artworks also serve as teaching and learning resources that complement the art curriculum.
