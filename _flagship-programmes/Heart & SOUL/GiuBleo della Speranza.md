_Laudate_, our Art Exhibition in Praise of God’s Blessings, includes art pieces from various inter-religious communities, CCPS alumnae and our sister schools – the St Anthony’s Canossian Primary and Secondary Schools. We are thrilled at the many talented children we have here at Canossa Catholic Primary and Canossian School whose art works were showcased. 

Enjoy this 3 minute snapshot of the exhibition!
