<br>
<br>
The E2K Science Programme Singapore is a Science enrichment programme for children who demonstrate interest and ability in science. The programme is adapted from Israelâ€™s E2K Programme which is developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE).  
 <br>
The programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills among high-ability primary children in Science, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.  
 <br>
Children undertake the same processes that scientists use to generate knowledge in Science. Just as scientists make mistakes while determining the causes of phenomena in the real world, children are given the space to make mistakes, with the teachers present to help children to learn from them. Through collaborative learning and guidance from the teachers, children exercise scientific thinking and reasoning, grow in confidence and independence in carrying out scientific inquiry as well as develop scientific habits, attitudes and dispositions.
