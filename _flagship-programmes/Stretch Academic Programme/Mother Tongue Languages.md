<br>
The CCPS Mother Tongue Languages Lower Primary Stretch Programme aims to increase students’ exposure to the Mother Tongue Languages through the teaching of poetry and idioms in the Lower Primary.  
<br>
All Mother Tongue Languages have their own unique and beautiful sounds. Through reading aloud poetry and idioms, students discover the rhythm and rhyme inherent in their Mother Tongue and develop a deeper appreciation for the language. Moreover, as language and culture are deeply intertwined, students also grow in understanding of their culture while learning each poem and idiom.

</font></b>
<br>
<br>
Primary 3 and Primary 4 students are offered Higher Mother Tongue (HMT) from 2022 as the curriculum deepens their knowledge and appreciation for the language and culture.  
<br>
The Higher Mother Tongue (HMT) curriculum will also expose students to ethnic literature, help them develop higher-order thinking skills, and learn grammar and syntax through creative activities and games. Students with interest and aptitude in Chinese, Malay and Tamil Language are thus given opportunities to develop their potential in this subject area. Higher Mother Tongue continues to be an opt-in curriculum in the Upper Primary years.
