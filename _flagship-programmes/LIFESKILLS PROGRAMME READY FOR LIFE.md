**<font size=5>R.E.A.D.Y. for Life</font>**

  
**R.E.A.D.Y. for Life** Programme is a school-based programme designed to help our students  
  

*   Acquire life skills and competencies that are not explicitly taught in the formal curriculum or
*   Hone the life skills and competencies that have been covered in some way in the formal curriculum but would require deepening of understanding, regular practice and reinforcement

  
These life skills will empower the students to be  <br>
**R** – Responsible in making sound decisions, especially when they are under pressure  
**E** – Effective in dealing with basic day-to-day demands in life  
**A** – Amicable in building relationships and handling challenges  
**D** \- Determined in seeing through every commitment  
**Y** – Yielding to GRACE and TRUTH, not fear

  
**R.E.A.D.Y. for Life** consists of a series of modules that are conducted in a year and across the levels in a progressive manner.  
  
**<font size=5>Starting School Right</font>**

Conducted at the beginning of the school year, the 3-day module consists of a number of activities and lessons that provide opportunities for our students to explore different themes and be equipped with competencies and skills that are explicitly taught and reinforced progressively across their 6 years of education. It instils our school values (Charity, Humility, Forgiveness, Faith) and promotes the acquisition of learning dispositions (shares ideas and thoughts with others; works well with others, open to feedback and acts on it to improve, perseveres and does not give up easily).
