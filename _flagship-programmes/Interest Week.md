Discovering the Unique Me! aims to inspire our children to aspire by providing platforms for them to explore their values, interests, personalities and skills, raise their awareness of different types of education and career pathways and equip themselves with the values, skills and dispositions of lifelong learning to make informed choices regarding their education.

The 5-day programme was broken down into 3 segments - Experience, Encounter and Engage. During the Experience stage, our children acquire new knowledge, skills and dispositions from their teachers, instructors or coaches. During the Encounter stage, our children had the opportunity to meet with professionals from the respective industries and have a meaningful conversation and encounter with the guest speakers. Throughout this 5-day programme, our children were engaged (Engage Stage) and continuously reflected on their experiences and learning. 

  

Recognising that every child is different and has varied interest and passion, our children were given the opportunity to explore and discover their interests in 12 different modules - Animation, Cajon, Cartooning, Culinary, Design, Drama, Entrepreneurship, Inline Skate, Jazz Dance, Media, Soccer and Urban Farming.

  

### Animation - The Magic of Stop Motion

Students learned to use everyday items to create a unique film using the frame-by-frame animation technique and the simplified steps to make a film - storyboarding, creating sets, visual and sound editing.
