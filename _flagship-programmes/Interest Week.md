<i>Interest Week</i> is a big part of our school’s Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme – <i>Discovering the Unique Me!</i> It aims to inspire our children to aspire by providing platforms for them to explore their values, interests, personalities and skills, raise their awareness of different types of education and career pathways and equip themselves with the values, skills and dispositions of lifelong learning to make informed choices regarding their education.

This 5-day programme is broken down into 3 segments - <i>Experience, Encounter and Engage</i>. During the <i>Experience</i> stage, our children acquire new knowledge, skills and dispositions from their teachers, instructors or coaches. During the <i>Encounter</i> stage, our children will have the opportunity to meet with professionals from the respective industries and have a meaningful conversation and encounter with them. Throughout this 5-day programme, our children are engaged and immersed fully in their learning (<i>Engage</i> Stage) and they will reflect on their experiences and learning by articulating their interest and aspiration and making plans to follow their dreams.
<br><br>
Recognising that every child is different and has varied interest and passion, our children are given the opportunity to explore and discover their interests in different modules that are related to different industries in Singapore such as culinary, architectural modelling, game creation and soccer.
