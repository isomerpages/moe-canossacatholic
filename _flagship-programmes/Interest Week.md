Discovering the Unique Me! aims to inspire our children to aspire by providing platforms for them to explore their values, interests, personalities and skills, raise their awareness of different types of education and career pathways and equip themselves with the values, skills and dispositions of lifelong learning to make informed choices regarding their education.

The 5-day programme was broken down into 3 segments - Experience, Encounter and Engage. During the Experience stage, our children acquire new knowledge, skills and dispositions from their teachers, instructors or coaches. During the Encounter stage, our children had the opportunity to meet with professionals from the respective industries and have a meaningful conversation and encounter with the guest speakers. Throughout this 5-day programme, our children were engaged (Engage Stage) and continuously reflected on their experiences and learning. 
<br>
<br>
Recognising that every child is different and has varied interest and passion, our children were given the opportunity to explore and discover their interests in different modules such as culinary, design, soccer and game development.

<br><br>
Our students usually look forward to this segment of Interest Week. During the ‘Encounter’ stage, our students get to meet guest speakers who are involved in the industries they have chosen to learn more about during the Interest Week. The guest speakers inspire our students to dream and see the countless possibilities that they have. They also raise our students’ awareness on the possible career opportunities through their sharing and stories.

<br><br>
By the end of this 5-day programme, our students will be able to apply what they have learnt through the products they made, a tournament, a showcase or a presentation to a group of audience. They are able to articulate their interest and aspiration as they pen down their reflections in their #Canossian booklets. They are able to make connections to their career possibilities, personal interests and aspirations and make plans to follow their dreams.
