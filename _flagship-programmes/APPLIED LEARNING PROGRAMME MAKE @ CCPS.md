**<font size=6>APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME - M.A.K.E@CCPS</font>**

  
  
We believe that every student in CCPS will  
  

*   Make a difference especially in sustaining the environment,
*   Apply Design Thinking, Technology, Knowledge of Science & Environment, and Mathematics,
*   Kindle their spirit of innovation through experimentation / prototyping, having the courage to try and not afraid of failing,
*   Exercise initiative in learning, making improvement and collaborating with others.

  
Our students participate in various collaborative team-based project work. Through application of Design Thinking processes, they learn to empathise with the people affected by certain issues, identify the problem and design a solution to address the problem identified. In order to enact students’ solutions in some way, block-based programming is introduced progressively across all levels through various coding modules and our students get to apply their Mathematics and Science concepts, reasoning and logical thinking in their projects which are anchored on the theme of sustainability. Having a focus on sustainability is part of the school’s response to “Laudato Si'”, the Pope’s encyclical letter, which urges the Catholics to take action against the injustice of climate change and calls for care of our common home, Earth, and to protect the poor and future generations.  
  
**The Environment and Me**

Our Primary 1 students are introduced to coding through KUBO Robotics, which provides a screen-free concrete experience in coding. Using tagtiles, they learn to programme the movements for KUBO, a little robot, and are introduced to the concept of direction and programme it to solve a real-world sustainability problem identified (e.g. land pollution).
