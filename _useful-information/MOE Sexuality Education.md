<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> &nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about
enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the
importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging
healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended
family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for
the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities
in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> &nbsp; The goals of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p><strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To help students make wise, responsible
and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate <u>knowledge</u> on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
<p><strong>(ii)</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To help students know themselves
and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of <u>social and emotional skills</u> of
self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours,
development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication,
problem-solving and decision-making skills; and</p>
<p><strong>(iii)</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To help students develop a moral
compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised
on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of <u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u> about
sexuality. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> &nbsp; The key messages of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p><strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
<br><strong>(ii)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);
<br><strong>(iii)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make
responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and
<br><strong>(iv)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstinence
before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended
pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.

<br><strong>Overview of Canossa Catholic Primary School's Sexuality Education Programme for 2024</strong> 
<br>
<br><strong>4.</strong> &nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic
manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education
is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships,
Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may

<br>
<br>
<br><strong>5.</strong> &nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality
include:
<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Science
<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong> 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>6.</strong> &nbsp; The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty.
With better nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty
at a younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological
changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming
biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having
the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours.
Furthermore, our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that
could endanger health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students
require guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual
messages in the media and other sources.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>7.</strong> &nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught
as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students learn to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters. &nbsp;

of love and infatuation, and identify the strong emotions that may arise
from experiencing the feelings of infatuation. They will recognise that
experiencing feelings of infatuation is part of growing up and becoming
infatuated with someone does not mean that they should be involved in a
romantic relationship. Instead, they should focus on building strong and
healthy friendships with their circles of friends.
