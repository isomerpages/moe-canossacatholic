To facilitate collaboration, teaching and learning between teachers and children, children will be provided with a student MOE iCON (Google) account which will allow access to common G Suite Services, Zoom, and Microsoft Pro Plus (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote, Publisher). Children will be using the same account throughout their primary and secondary education.  
  
CCPS will be rolling out Student iCON progressively.
