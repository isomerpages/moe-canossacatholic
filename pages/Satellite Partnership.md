**<font size=5>Overview</font>**

The Satellite Partnership between Canossa Catholic Primary School (CCPS) and [Canossian School](http://www.canossian.edu.sg/) (CS) provides students from both schools with meaningful opportunities to interact and integrate. 

  

This special partnership gives students from both schools the opportunity to learn and participate in all activities, academic and non-academic, side by side. Through encountering peers who are different from themselves, the students learn to cherish each other’s unique gifts and talents. It is through journeying together that the students learn that while they may be different from each other in every way, they will always be equal in dignity.
